# DeepLearningForVisualRecognition

This repo contains assignments for the course Deep Learning for Visual Recoginition taught at University of Bonn in WS 2020-21. Below you will find a short summary of the assignment and possibly some visualizations of what we did.

## Sheet 01

In this assignment we implemented, tested and trained k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier and a linear classifier with the logistic function. We used Fashion-MNIST dataset to check the performance of the classification algorithms.
